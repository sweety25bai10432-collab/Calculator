Problem Statement

Many basic calculators can perform simple arithmetic operations, but users often require additional mathematical functions such as trigonometry, logarithms, factorials, LCM/HCF, roots and learners working on mathematics.
Switching between different online tools or calculators can be inconvenient.
This project solves the problem by providing a single, console-based multi-functional scientific calculator that can perform both simple and advanced operations in one place. It reduces effort, saves time, and enhances learning by allowing users to practice various computations through an interactive Python program.

Scope of the Project

The project focuses on creating a command-line scientific calculator capable of executing multiple categories of mathematical operations.
Scope includes:
1. Basic arithmetic functions
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, floor division.
2. Intermediate mathematical functions
Exponentiation, square roots, cube roots, percentage calculation.
3. Number theory functions
LCM and HCF (GCD) computation.
4. Advanced scientific functions
Trigonometric calculations (sin, cos, tan)
Logarithms with user-defined bases
Factorial of a number
5. User interaction
Menu-driven choice system
Continuous operation using loops
Input validation for incorrect choices
