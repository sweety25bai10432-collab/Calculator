# Calculator

Overview:

The calculator program allows the user to select operation among 15 operations and to input two or single numeric values as per the operation. Based on the chosen operation, the program performs the calculation and displays the result.  

Features:

1.Basic Arithmetic Operations
a. Addition
b. Subtraction
c. Multiplication
d. Division
e. Floor Division
f. Modulus
2.Advanced Mathematical Operations
a. Exponentiation
b. Square Roots
c. Cube Roots
d. Factorial
e. Percentage Calculation
3. Number Theory Functions
a. LCM (Least Common Multiple)
b. HCF (Highest Common Factor)
4. Trigonometric Functions
a. Sine
b. Cosine
c. Tangent
4. Logarithmic Functions
a. Logarithm with any base
5. User-Friendly Menu System
a. Displays a list of 15 operations
b. Allows users to repeat operations

Technologies / Tools Used:

1. Programming Language
a. Python 3.13
2. Python Standard Library Modules
a. math (for trigonometric, logarithmic, root, and gcd functions)
3. Development Tools (optional)
Any code editor such as:
a. VS Code
b. IDLE
c. Jupyter Notebook

Steps to Install & Run the Project:

1. Install Python (if not installed)
Download & install Python from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Create/Download the Script
Save your code in a file named:
calculator.py
3. Open Terminal / Command Prompt
Navigate to the directory where you saved the script:
cd path/to/your/project
4. Run the Program
python calculator.py
The calculator will start and displays the main menu.

Instructions for Testing:

Follow these steps to test the calculator:
1. Run the script
The menu with 15 options will be displayed.
2. Choose an operation
For example, enter:
1
to test Addition.
3. Enter required inputs
The program will prompt for numbers depending on the operation:
a. Two numbers for arithmetic, LCM/HCF, exponent, etc.
b. One number for sqrt, factorial, cube root.
c. Angle in degrees for trigonometry.
4. Validate the output
Ensure the result matches expected mathematical values.
5. Test invalid inputs
Try things like:
a. Entering letters instead of numbers
b. Dividing by zero
c. Choosing incorrect menu numbers
6. Repeat or exit
The program will ask:
Let's do next calculation? (yes/no):
Enter no to exit.
